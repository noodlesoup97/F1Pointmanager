# F1 Pointmanager
 Version 1.0
 
# Description
 Since F1 2014 does not provide a automatic mechanism to count the drivers/teams points in a splitscreen season, this program gives        a solution for the problem.
 
# Features
 Points for an entire F1 2014 season can be tracked for Drivers as well as for Constructors.\n
 Currently, the program only supports one player driving as Magnussen for McLaren and the other one as Raikkonen for Ferrari.
 The program only tracks points for the top 4 constructors (Mercedes, Ferrari, RedBull, McLaren) and its Drivers.
 You have to type in the places after each race for each driver seperately.
 
# Requirements
 Written in C++ with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.
 The ./debug contains an executable F1Pointsmanager.exe file
