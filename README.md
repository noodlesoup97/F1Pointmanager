# F1 Pointmanager
 Version 1.0
 
# Description
 Since F1 2014 dropped the drivers/constructors point-recognition in splitscreen mode, this project presents a point-storing console program so that you can track the point course of a season :)
 
# Features
 - Points for an entire F1 2014 season can be tracked for Drivers as well as for Constructors.

 - Drivers and Constructors table shows the difference to the current leader.

# DevNotes
 
 - Currently, the program only supports Player1 driving as Magnussen for McLaren and Player2 as Raikkonen for Ferrari.
 
 - The program only tracks points for the Top 4 Constructors (Mercedes, Ferrari, RedBull, McLaren) and their Drivers.
 
 - You have to type in the places after each race for each driver seperately, not their points!
