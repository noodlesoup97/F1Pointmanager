# F1 Pointmanager
 Version 1.0
 
# Description
 Since F1 2014 does not provide a automatic mechanism to count the drivers/teams points in a splitscreen season, this program gives        a solution for the problem.
 
# Features
 Currently, the program only supports one player driving as Magnussen for McLaren and the other one as Raikkonen for Ferrari.
 The program only tracks points for the top 4 teams (Mercedes, Ferrari, RedBull, McLaren).
 You have to tip in the places for each driver seperately.
 
# Requirements
 Written in C++ with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.
