# F1 Pointmanager
 Version 1.0
 
# Description
 Since F1 2014 dropped the drivers/constructors point-recognition in splitscreen mode, this project presents a point-storing console program so that you can track the point course of a season :)
 
# Features
 Points for an entire F1 2014 season can be tracked for Drivers as well as for Constructors.
 
 Currently, the program only supports Player1 driving as Magnussen for McLaren and Player2 as Raikkonen for Ferrari.
 
 The program only tracks points for the top 4 constructors (Mercedes, Ferrari, RedBull, McLaren) and their Drivers.
 
 You have to type in the places after each race for each driver seperately.
 
 Driver and Constructor tables show the difference to the current leader.
 
# Usage
 Run the executable F1Pointsmanager.exe from the ./debug folder
 
 # Additionals
 Written in C++ with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.
 
 This program should be used for entertaining purposes only.
